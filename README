## ✧ setup guide

✩ remember to save after adding every credential ✩

you'll need to get some special tokens to make the extension work:

### notion setup
1. create a notion integration at [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. copy your integration token and paste into the secret token box (save)
3. create or choose a notion page where you want your tasks
4. share that page with your integration!!!
5. copy the page id from the url and paste into the url box (save)

### canvas setup
1. go to your canvas account settings
2. create a new access token
3. copy the token and paste it into the canvas token box (save)
4. copy your canvas url and paste that into it's box (save)

### extension setup
1. click the extension icon in your toolbar
2. check that all your tokens and ids match with the instructions (?) in right hand corner
3. click "sync now" to test it out ✧

## ✦ using dummy data

if you just want to test things out, you can check "use dummy data" in the settings. 

## ✧ customization

feel free to modify the css to match your aesthetic. all the sparkles are in `popup.css`. you can remove them if they are distracting
in the future i'm hoping to add more customization options!

## ✦ troubleshooting

if something isn't working right:
- make sure all your tokens are correct
- check that you've shared your notion page with your integration
- try resetting and entering your settings again

## ✧ security & privacy

✦ all your tokens and credentials are stored locally in your chrome browser
✦ sensitive data (like tokens) is encrypted before being saved to storage
✦ no data is ever sent to external servers (only to notion and canvas apis)
✦ your information never leaves your computer except to sync your tasks
✦ i never see or have access to any of your personal data
